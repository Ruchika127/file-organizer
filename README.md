# Python File Organizer

This Python File Organizer is a simple tool to automatically sort files in a specified directory into subfolders based on file extensions. By organizing files into categorized folders, this script helps keep directories tidy and improves file management.

## How It Works

The program:
1. Prompts the user for a directory path.
2. Scans the directory and identifies file extensions.
3. Creates subfolders for each unique file extension (if they don't already exist).
4. Moves each file into its respective subfolder based on its extension.

This project uses Python’s built-in `os` and `shutil` libraries, making it an easy, lightweight solution for file organization. It’s ideal for users looking to keep download folders, project files, or other collections organized with minimal effort.
